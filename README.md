### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I while ago I refused to call myself a 'passionate programmer', but thinking it twice I think I am cause:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on refactors and cleanups over legacy applications.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always apply software to real life problems.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ruby, swift and elixir.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on developer comunities.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to make sour doug bread
